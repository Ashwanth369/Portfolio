By implementing lazy loading and refactoring legacy code across HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I improved page load times by over 35% and boosted user engagement. I also built XML-based content management tools that simplified site updates and reduced bounce rates. The entire solution was deployed with a continuous delivery setup, ensuring smooth updates and long-term maintainability."

I improved the framework’s performance by introducing Java concurrency patterns and designing microservices that processed analytics workloads efficiently. On the cloud side, I developed and deployed Python-based analytics using AWS Lambda, Step Functions, and S3, significantly reducing latency across the platform. I also led the Monocerous Project, where I built an optimization engine using Gurobi to minimize operational costs, and trained LSTM models in PyTorch to forecast energy demand with high accuracy. To support these models, I built automated testing pipelines and dashboards with PyTest and Streamlit, making the results actionable in real-time."
